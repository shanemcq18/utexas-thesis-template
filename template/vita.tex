The Vita is a brief biographical sketch of the writer that provides information for future readers.
\index{Vita@\emph{Vita}}
The Vita page is optional and most often includes the author's full name, a contact method (we recommend using an email address where he or she may be reached), and the name of the typist.
Because your ETD will be available electronically, be aware that certain personal information could be used to steal your identity.
For this reason, you are advised not to include your date of birth, physical address, parents' names, or children's names.

The Vita can be more than one paragraph / page, but it will look best if it fits on a single page.
