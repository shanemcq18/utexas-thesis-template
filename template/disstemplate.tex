\previousdegrees{B.S.}
     % The abbreviated form of your previous degree(s).

% Commands for master's theses and reports.			     %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% If the degree you're seeking is NOT Doctor of Philosophy, uncomment
% (remove the % in front of) the following two command lines (the ones
% that have the \ as their second character).
%
%\degree{MASTER OF ARTS}
%\degreeabbr{M.A.}

% Uncomment the line below that corresponds to the type of master's
% document you are writing.
%
%\masterreport
%\masterthesis


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Some optional commands to change the document's defaults.	     %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%\singlespacing
%\oneandonehalfspacing

%\singlespacequote
\oneandonehalfspacequote

\topmargin 0.125in	% Adjust this value if the PostScript file output
			% of your dissertation has incorrect top and 
			% bottom margins. Print a copy of at least one
			% full page of your dissertation (not the first
			% page of a chapter) and measure the top and
			% bottom margins with a ruler. You must have
			% a top margin of 1.5" and a bottom margin of
			% at least 1.25". The page numbers must be at
			% least 1.00" from the bottom of the page.
			% If the margins are not correct, adjust this
			% value accordingly and re-compile and print again.
			%
			% The default value is 0.125"

		% If you want to adjust other margins, they are in the
		% utdiss2-nn.sty file near the top. If you are using
		% the shell script Makediss on a Unix/Linux system, make
		% your changes in the utdiss2-nn.sty file instead of
		% utdiss2.sty because Makediss will overwrite any changes
		% made to utdiss2.sty.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Some optional commands to be tested.				     %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If there are 10 or more sections, 10 or more subsections for a section,
% etc., you need to make an adjustment to the Table of Contents with the
% command \longtocentry.

This document has the form of a ``fake'' doctoral dissertation
in order to provide an example of such, but it is actually a
copy of Miguel Lerma's documentation for the Mathematics
Department Computer Seminar of 25 March 1998 updated in July 2001
and following by Craig McCluskey to meet the March 2001
requirements of the Graduate School.

This document and its source file show to write a Doctoral Dissertation using 
\LaTeX{} and the utdiss2 package.

% can even change the chapter order by merely interchanging the order
% of the include statements (something I found helpful in my own

\begin{vita}
Craig William McCluskey
was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on 20 May 1950, the son of
Dr. William R. McCluskey and Lucilla W. McCluskey.  He received the Bachelor
of Science degree in Engineering from the California Institute of Technology
and was commissioned an Officer in the United States Air Force in 1971.
He entered active duty in October, 1971, and was stationed in Denver, Colorado,
Colorado Springs, Colorado, Panama City, Florida, and Sacramento, California.
He separated from the USAF in 1975 and worked as an engineer for several small
electronics companies in California before moving to Colorado Springs, Colorado
to work for Hewlett-Packard in 1979. He left Hewlett-Packard in 1989 and joined
a small company based in Herndon, Virginia, working out of his house as a
``remote'' engineer designing parts of the Alexis satellite for Los Alamos
National Laboratories. Laid off when his portion of the satellite was
completed, he applied to the University of Texas at Austin for enrollment
in their physics program. He was accepted and started graduate studies in
August, 1991.
